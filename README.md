git clone https://github.com/your-repository/react-antd-style-override.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   
cd react-antd-style-override

3. Install dependencies:

npm install or yarn

## Running the Application

To start the development server, run:

npm run dev or yarn dev


The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Customizing Styles

Styles can be overridden by modifying the `.less` files. Ensure that your class names correctly target the AntD components you wish to customize.
